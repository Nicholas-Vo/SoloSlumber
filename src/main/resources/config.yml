# Does waking up a sleeper revert to vanilla sleep? Set this to
# `true` to allow anyone to veto single-player sleep for one
# night cycle.
# NOTE that feature depends on world time not going backwards.
# Commands like built-in command `/time set day` resets world
# time back to zero.  Consider Essentials `/day` instead.

# The worlds that this plugin should listen for sleepers.
# Note that each world is handled separately.  Sleeping off
# night in a particular world will not affect other worlds
# listed here.
